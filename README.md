This is a Website to Check the weather from multiple sources!

This is a nice little side project That I made on my blog https://blog.arisamiga.rocks/post/weather/.

## How to Use?
When going on the webpage either on https://arisamiga.github.io/Weather-App or your localhost you enter a city on the input box and press the `search` button.

The App will create a card with weather information from each source. You can have multiple cards at once!
